c99 does not have a direct 'bool'-type. However it recognices the following:
	0 	is false;
	nonzero is true;

when dealing with constants (numbers, booleans) use the following convention:
	putInt ("int", 0, $1, NULL)
	putInt ("boolean", 0, 1, NULL)

execute 'build' to build the project:
	./build

when entering stuff in the compiler be sure to put everything into a function, except the declaration of global variables, e.g:

int global=0;
int main () { int i; if(i==0) {i=1;} return 0; }

or

int global=1337;
int main () { int i; while(i==0) {i=1;} return 0; }
