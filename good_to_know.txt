c99 does not have a direct 'bool'-type. However it recognices the following:
	0 	is false;		
	nonzero is true;	//use 1 as true for best practice; also note the section about weird c-code for that one

when dealing with constants (numbers, booleans) use the following convention:
	putInt ("int", 0, $1, NULL)		//name all int values int
	etc. ...
	
the following weird stuff is legal c code:
	<var> = <boolean expression>
	int i,j;
	i=1==2; //i has the value of 0
	j=2==2; //j has the value of 1

execute 'build' to build the project:
	./build

when entering stuff in the compiler be sure to put everything into a function, except the declaration of global variables, e.g:

	int global; int main () { global=0; int i; if(i==0) {i=1;} return 0; }

	or

	int global; int main () { global=1337; int i; while(i==0) {i=1;} return 0; }
